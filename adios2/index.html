<p>In ADIOS 2.0, EVPath and its supporting libraries have been pulled in as
"third-party" suported libraries in the general ADIOS2 source tree.  You
should only attempt to build EVPath as an external package if you have some
very strong reason for not prefering the provided versions and probably you
should talk to someone about that.
